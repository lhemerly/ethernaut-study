# Ethernaut Study

This is a personal project to study all challenges of the Ethernaut Open Zeppelin War Game.

The objective of this repository is to archive the scripts and contracts used with extensive
commentary of the steps taken to hack each challenge.

I'm doing all challenges without consulting third parties or reading the attack contracts
in the Ethernaut repository.

I'm currently working on the Gatekeeper One challenge. I got past all checks but gate three.
